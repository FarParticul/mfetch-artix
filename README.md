# Minimal-Fetch
Minimal fetch is a more ascetically pleasing system fetching tool!

## What it actually looks like

STILL A WIP DO NOT EXPECT IT TO BE FLAWLESS
Please report any issues you find I would love to improve this script

## Install with
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ToxicWaveHD/Minimal-Fetch.git
$ cd Minimal-Fetch/
$ chmod +x make
$ ./make
```

## Simply run with
```
$ mfetch
```

## Dependencys
```
neofetch
python
```

## Todo
1. Add more distro logos (please do commit any you make)
2. Make a custom information grabber (rather than have the neofetch dependency ðŸ’€)
3. Add more customization options
4. Maybe upload it to AUR if I decide to finish it.
