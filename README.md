# Minimal-Fetch
Minimal fetch is a more ascetically pleasing system fetching tool!

## What it actually looks like

STILL A WIP DO NOT EXPECT IT TO BE FLAWLESS
Please do report any issues you find

## Install with
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ToxicWaveHD/Minimal-Fetch.git
$ cd Minimal-Fetch/
$ chmod +x make
$ ./make
```

## Simply run with
```
$ mfetch
```

## Config howto
WARNING FAIL SAFES HAVE YET TO BE ADDED IF YOU ENCOUNTER ANY ERRORS WHILE RUNNING AFTER EDITING THE CONFIG REVERT ANY CHANGES MADE
```
The config is located at ~/.config/mfetch/options

True/False statements MUST be capitalised

The os logo has to be a directory in /usr/share/mfetch/logos
```

## Dependencys
```
neofetch
python
python3-pillow
python3-psutil
```

## Todo
1. Add more distro logos
3. Make a custom information grabber (rather than have the neofetch dependency ðŸ’€)
4. Add more customization options
5. Maybe upload it to AUR if I decide to finish it.

Any improvements, features or new logos would be very welcome :)
